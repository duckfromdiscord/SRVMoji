# SRVMoji

An addon for [DiscordSRV](https://github.com/DiscordSRV/DiscordSRV/) that will convert all Discord messages with `:emoji:` in them into a format that will display exactly the same as they otherwise would for players without a resource pack, but for those using [AmberW's PixelTwemoji pack](https://github.com/AmberWat/PixelTwemojiMC-18), that will be used to display compatible emoji.
